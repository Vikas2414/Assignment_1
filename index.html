                A dosa is a rice pancake, originating from South India, made from a fermented batter. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance. Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt. Dosas are a typical part of diets throughout South India, but the dish is now popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, dosas are served hot along with sambar and chutney. </p>
